Code Breaker is a JavaScript game that challenges players to crack a code by arranging colors. The game presents a set of colored pegs, and the player must use logic and deduction to arrange them in the correct order to match the hidden code. With each attempt, players are given feedback on the accuracy of their guesses, allowing them to gradually narrow down the possibilities and solve the puzzle. The game offers a fun and engaging way to exercise problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
